#🧠 What Is a Variable?
#A variable is a name you give to a piece of data so you can use it later. Think of it like labeling a jar:

age = 10
#Here, age is the jar, and 10 is what's inside.

#🧃 Why Use Variables?
#To store information
#To reuse values
#To make your code easy to read and change

#📏 Rules for Naming Variables
#Python is chill, but it has a few rules you must follow:

#✅ Allowed:

#Must start with a letter or an underscore (_)
#Can include letters, numbers, and underscores
#Can be any length
name = "Zola"
_age = 25
user123 = "hello"


#❌ Not Allowed:
#Can’t start with a number
#2cool = "nope"  # ❌ Error!
#Can’t use spaces
#user name = "oops"  # ❌ Error!
#Can’t use Python keywords like if, while, class, etc.

#🧠 Best Practices (Good Habits)
#Use clear names: score, price, user_name

#Use lowercase letters (snake_case is common)

#Avoid single letters unless it’s temporary (like x, y in math)

#🧪 Example Time!

name = "Lebo"
age = 30
height = 1.75

print(name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height, "meters")
# This code defines variables for a person's name, age, and height, then prints them.

#This will print:
#Lebo
#Age: 30
#Height: 1.75 meters
